#while the # of twee is less the # of total og tweets, i will keep going

# using same messages. to iterate to different messages need array iteration..


tweet = 1  #using while loop to iterate to a number
total = 10  # give total

while tweet < total #statement
  puts "#{tweet} this is not enough we need some more!!"
  tweet += 1 # increments +1 each time. the code is executing ang loops. it stop[s when it reaches 10
